### **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**  

This repository has Macarena Villamea's submission for the final project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" created by John's Hopkins University at Coursera.  
It has three files:  

*  **$\color{red}{\text{CodeBook.md:}}$** A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.  

*   **$\color{red}{\text{run_analysis.R:}}$** The script for performing the analysis.  

*   **$\color{red}{\text{TidyData.txt:}}$**  The exported final data.
